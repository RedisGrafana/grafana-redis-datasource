## Introduction

### What is the Grafana Redis Datasource?

The Grafana Redis Datasource, is a plugin that allows users to connect to Redis database and build dashboards in Grafana to easily monitor Redis data. It provides out-of-the box predefined dashboards - but the plugin allows to build entirely customized dashboards, tuned to your needs.

### What is Grafana?

If you are not familiar with Grafana yet, it is a very popular tool used to build dashboards allowing to monitor applications, infrastructures and any kind of software components.

### What Grafana version is supported?

Only Grafana 7.0 and later with a new plugin platform supported.

### Does this datasource require anything special configured on the Redis databases?

Datasource can connect to any Redis database. No special configuration is required.

### Do you need to build the datasource?

Yes. We are planning to add the datasource to Grafana repository as soon as version 1.0.0 is released, then it can be installed using
`grafana-cli` from registry. Please follow [**Build datasource**](#build-datasource).

## Getting Started

### Build datasource

To learn step by step how to build Redis Datasource from scratch and register in new or existing Grafana please take a look at [BUILD](https://github.com/RedisTimeSeries/grafana-redis-datasource/blob/master/BUILD.md) instructions.

#### React frontend

- Install frontend dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

- Build frontend

```bash
yarn build
```

#### Golang backend

- Install [Grafana plugin SDK for Go](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/developers/plugins/backend/grafana-plugin-sdk-for-go/) dependency

```bash
go get -u github.com/grafana/grafana-plugin-sdk-go
```

- Build backend plugin binaries for Linux, Windows and MacOS

```bash
mage -v
```

### Run using docker-compose

Project provides `docker-compose.yml` to start Redis with RedisTimeSeries module and Grafana 7.0.

**Start Redis and Grafana**

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Open Grafana in your browser [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and configure datasource

You can add as many datasources as you want to support multiple Redis databases.

There are certain settings that can be configured based on your own setup:

- Grafana port
- Datasource URL

#### Configure Grafana port in `docker-compose.yml`

If standard port 3000 is occupied by another application update the port to bind Grafana to

```
    ports:
      - '3000:3000'
```

#### Configure Datasource url in `provisioning/datasources/redis.yaml`

If Redis is running and listening on localhost:6379 no changes are required

```
    url: redis://localhost:6379
```

If Redis is running as Docker container on MacOS, please update host to `host.docker.internal`

```
    url: redis://host.docker.internal:6379
```

## Supported Commands

Datasource supports many Redis commands using custom components and provide unified interface to query any command.
